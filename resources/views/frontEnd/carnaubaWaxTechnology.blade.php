                  Carnauba wax is a resin obtained from the leaves of a palm tree called Copernica Cerifera. Brazilian natives often refer to the Carnauba tree as the "Tree of Life," because it is used in so many ways to nourish and support.<br><br>

                Pure Carnauba wax has the highest melting point of all natural waxes and is widely accepted as the hardest commercial wax known to man. Pure Carnauba, in its natural state, is harder than concrete. One of its most interesting properties is that it swells and closes its pores when exposed to water. Carnauba wax also has the ability to retain oil and has excellent gloss properties.

                 Prime Yellow, Grade #1 Carnauba Wax is derived from leaves of the Carnauba Palm Tree before the leaves have completely unfolded and been exposed to the sun. This is the most optically pure and considered of the highest quality. It is also the most expensive.
